# Alongside Vulernability

A contract created to hide vulnerabilities for an assignment for Alongside.xyz application process.

This repository is based on the [Solidity Template from paulrberg](https://github.com/PaulRBerg/foundry-template).

The contract itself is a simple index token `(ETH-LSD-Index)` that represents `stETH`, `rETH` and `cbETH`.

## Room for improving the contract

Here are some ways the contract could be improved, as it is quite simple as I had a time constraint.

- Better asset rebalancing. Such as:
  - Only bring 1 asset, and sell that automatically for the other 3
  - Bring a different proportion of each asset, based on price, to mint an index token (would need an oracle)
- Customizable by owner or governance the different types of ETH LSDs used (such as adding frxETH or removing cbETH)
